## My Process
### Built with
-Semantic HTML5 markup
-CSS custom properties
-CSS Grid
#### What I learned
- I was able to learn more about coloring, how the same color might not actually look the same if the brightness aren't the same.
- I also was able to learn how to center a grid.
- I also learn spacing.
- I also learnt how to use external font and font size for my paragraph and H tag.
